#DESCRIPTION
Exciting New Project Completed!

I'm thrilled to share my latest project: a sleek and modern online calculator. This project was a fantastic opportunity to focus on creating a functional and visually appealing interface.

 Technologies Used:
- *HTML:* Structured the content effectively.
- *CSS:* Styled the platform with precision, using flexbox and grid for layout management.

 Lessons Learned:
- Enhanced my skills in CSS grid and flexbox.
- Gained a deeper understanding of responsive design principles.

I'm excited to continue improving it with more dynamic features using JavaScript in the future.
